# ZIRC

Zig seems like an interesting language. I wanted to make an IRC server and client in order to have a meatier introduction to Zig than just watching a few talks.

The two main goals are for the client program to be fully IRC-compliant such that it can join and IRC-compliant server, and for the server to have some extra goodies for ZIRC clients specifically, such as end-to-end encryption support.
